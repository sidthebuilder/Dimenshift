# 🚀 Dimenshift – A 4D Voxel Sandbox Game


**Dimenshift** is an experimental sandbox game engine that lets you explore and interact with voxel worlds in **four spatial dimensions**.  
Originally inspired by an abandoned prototype, it has now been revived and reimagined into a futuristic game concept using **C# + SDL2**.
